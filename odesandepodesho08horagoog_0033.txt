INTRODUCTION. xxv

23. Horace was introduced to Maecenas a arenti in

tffifhE‘was definitely admitted to his circle. It was probabl
in ac 37 that Maecenas invited h' with Ver Varius,
to accompany him on the ’ udishfflhich he
has umorously described in the fifth Satire. The acquaint-

attachment Maecenas found in Horace a man after his
own heart, wllose society gave him great content, and whose
good sense and sound moral libre were proof alike against
servility and presumption. He won Horace’s gratitude by

and sinoerity which made it plain that these favors were the
gifts of a friend and not of a mere patron, and that only
friendship was exacted in return. Others were quick enough
to point out the sociat inequality of the two men, and Horace

was once rnore forced to hear ill-natured remarks about ‘the '

freedman’s son'; but he comforted himself with the knowl-
edge that however it might have been on the former occa·
sion, when he was tribune in the army of Brutus, humble
birth was nota matter to be considered against personal
qualities in the choice of a friend, and that the distinguished
favor which he enjoyed was not purchased by any unworthy
compliances onhis part. The balance of obligation‚ in a
material point of view, was enormously against him ; but he
was ready, and franldy avowed his readiness, to resign all
these advantages rather than surrender his own inde
