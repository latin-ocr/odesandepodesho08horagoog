Horace himself, whereas Catullus had allowed himself the
full liberty of his Greek models as he found thern, so that his
verses sometimes, to the ears of later critics, had a touch
of harshness. It was not unnatural that Horace should re·
gard his own achievement, wrought out with much study and
labor, as the first adequate and successful adaptation of the
Lesbian rhythms to the Latin language, in comparison with
which the slighter efforts of Catullus might be deemed to
have gone, in point of artistic workmanship, liatle beyond
the point he had himself reached in his apodes> And his
claim, in this limited sense, must be allowed. But it is to be
wished that he had accorded to the genius of his predecessor
in lyric the same gerierous recognition which he gave to that
of Lucilius in satire.

27. Horace's Odes, many of which are addressed to one
or another of his friends, were privately read and circulated
long before they were published in collected form. The
first publication, which embraced three books, dedicated
in a fitting introductory ode to Maecenas, took place,
according to almost conclusive internal evidence, in mc. 23,
when Horace had reached the age of forty-twoss lt was the
‚gathered fruits of the best years of his life, when his mind
had attained its full maturity and his spirit had not yet
lost its freshness. The collection is arranged with some

reference to the chronological order of composition, but with · ’

more to variety of subject and pleasing sequence of rhythms..
The odes range in quality from mere studies or versions
from the Greek to products of the poet's matured skill and
poems in which motive and thought are wholly Roman.
Horace gave his work to the world with the undisguised assur-⁴
auce of its immortality and his own. '2st did not immediately
silence his detractors3 but it von its way surely, and· he did
not have to wait many years for a general verdict of approval

from the reading public‘· '
