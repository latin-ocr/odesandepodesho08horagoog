who is supposed to have written in the fourth century,-
perhaps earlier. At any rate he lived at a time when the
old Roman pagan customs had not yet died out, and he had
aceess to still older authorities which are now lost 3 so that
his work is ol great value to us. We also have a collection
of scholia under the name ot Helenius Acrae, adistinguished
grammarian who lived perhaps a century before Porphyrio;
but although Acro unquestionably wrote a commentary on
Horace, the one which now bears his name is a composite
, productiori, made up ata much later date by one or more
unknown writers, who quote liberally from Porphyrio.

Ι 38. Il we may take the word oi Jacques de Crusque
(better known by his Latinized name, Cruquius), professor
at Bruges in the latter part ol the sixteenth century, the
oldest manuscript ol Horace known to exist in modern times
was preserved in the monastery ol St. Peter at Blankenberg
(Mons Blandinius), near Ghent, and presumably perished
in the fire which consumed that institution in 1566. It was
’ one of iour codices which Cruquius had borrowed from the
monastery and collated ior his edition of Horace, which he
first published in complete form in 1578. Although, there·
lore, these Blandinian manuscripts are themselves lost, we
have in the edition ol Cruquius a considerable number ol
readings from them; and some oi these are oi a very strik-
ing character.. Cruquius regarded the manuscripts as of
great value; three of them he assigned to the ninth century
while the other, which he called ‘vetustissimus’ he thought
might possibly date from the seventh. We have no means
of revising this estimate. Keller and Holder, to whom we'
are indebted for the lullest existing critical apparatus of
Horace, question the accuracy and even the good laith of
Cruquius, and set little value on his manuscripts. The
majority of Horatian scholars, however, dissent from this
view and acquit Cruquius ol any worse offense than care·
