141. ln several ot the epodio disticha used by Horace, one
of the verses ia made up ol tvo distinct cola, one dactylic
and the other lambio or trochaic. Such a versele usually
‘asynartete,' that is, its two cola are not welded together (11,
for example, the two halves ol a hexameter are), but the end
of the first colon is treated in all respects 11 the end oi a
verse, having syllaba anceps, and admitting hiatus before a
following vowel. Whether the dactyl was read in trochaic
time (cyclic dactyl) is uncertain. It is not improbable that
there was a change ol time in the middle ol the verse.
