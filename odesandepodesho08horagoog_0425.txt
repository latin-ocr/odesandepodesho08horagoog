CARMEN SAECVLARE. 329

vas'set down as the fifth. The emperor Claudius, taking
roo years as his sacculum and the foundation ol the city as
'his startingpoint, celebrated the lestival in nn. 47 (a.v.c.
*lieo); so that some people who witnessed the pageant
uuder Augustus did live to see it again, aiter all. Domitian
chose the year 88; ior what reason, is not clear. The ninth
centennial oi the city was celebrated by Antoninus Pius.
Subsequent celebrations are recorded lor nn. 204 (2xl10
years irom ne. 17), 247 (eve. 1000), 259, and 298.
Vergil's lourth eclogue shows that certainly as early as
ne. 40, when the poem was written, and probably much
earlier, a Sibylline oracle was current, which loretold the '
near approach ol a regenerationol the world and the advent
ol a new Golden Age. lt was perhaps this prophecy and
the expectations and aspirations roused by it that suggested
to Augustus and his advisers the polleyol signalizing his
reign as a new 'era ol peace and happiness by celebrating
the Iudi saeculares with a magificenee that would at once
please and impress the people. The main outlines oi the
celebration were prescribed hythe maele, which hasbeen
preserved (Zosimus 11. 5), and the details were worked out
by Ateius Capito, the most learned expert oi the time in
pontifical law. Everything was done to make the occasion
memorabis, and a lasting record was provided by the erec·
tion oi two columns, one ol marble and one oi bronze,
inscribed with a lull account ol the celebration. These
monuments, which must have stood many centones, were
finally destroyed and their material turned to other uses3
‘but in 1890 some fragments oi the marble column were
exhumed in the neighborhood ol 'serentum and a consider·
able portion oi the inscription was thus recovered* It

*The inscription was edited, with a commentam, by Mommsen in
the Monumentr’ Anu chi delle Reale Accademr'a dei Li rucei, Vol. 1. p. 618
(1891). The article has also been printed separately. '
