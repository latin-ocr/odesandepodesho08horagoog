145. Most 01 the Odes are'composed in logaoedlcrhythms,
made up 01 trochaic, with an admixture 01 dactylis, elements.
The combination 01 dactyl and trochee produces a succes
sion 01 syllables identlcal with the chomamb (.. υ υ -), es·
pecially where the trochee is syncopated (··<) υ Ιιέ) and
the measure thus formed is repeated (as in 149 aud 150,
below). For this reason the rhythms were regarded by late
Roman metrical writers as choriambic, and some 01 the
¹ verses (147-150, and sometimes ¹5²) are still so called.
Their choriambic character is only apparent ; but it is never·
theless important to observe this measure, -which may, 101
convenience be called the tchoriambic measure'-—as its
repetition constitutos the characteristic feature 01 some 01 the
. verses now to be explained. Thus, in 149 the rhythm pro
ceeds through the choriamhic measure (-υ υ Ιι.) precisely
as in 1483 it then goes back, as it were, to the ,beginning
01 that measure and repeats it, but without syncopation
