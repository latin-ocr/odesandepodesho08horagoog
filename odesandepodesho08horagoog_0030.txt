xxii INTRODUCTION.

’ beiore him. The form which Horace adopted wasa couplet,
the second verse oi which, as a sort oi reirain, was called by
metrica! writers epo'dur (leodis, adjective ; , ci. ἐπᾴδειν). This
term was later extended in meaning, so that Horace's col-
lection oi seventeen poems, all but one composed oi epodic
couplets, has come down to us under the title oi Epodes
(Epodon liber). Horace himself called them only lambi,
which expresses their prevailing character and is sufficiently
accurate, although other metres are combined with the iambic
in some instances. .

19. The composition oi the Epodes probably began as
early as that oi the Satires, possibly earlier, and was con·
tinued through the same period. The sixteenth oi the
series, which displays at once remarkable mastery ot form
and immaturity of thought, was written in the first years
, after the poet’s return irorn Philippi, the ninth celebrates
the victory at Actium. The book was published about the
same tirne as the second book oi the Satires, sc. 30.

20. Horace says truly tha⁴t he reproduced the spirit as
well as the rhythms of Archilochus, in some oi his epodes l
· he has certainly used the iambus as ³ a weapon oi wrath' ln
others again he has descended to adepth oi coarseness from
which his later lyrics are, for the most part, happily free. l
These, the survivors perhaps of a larger number oi their
kind, belong, we must suppose, to his earliest efforts, and
tell ot a darlr period in his mental history, -the first years
aiter his return from Philippi—when life went hard with
him, and he was embittered and demoralized by associations
which later, under more congenial influences, he was able to
throw off. The most fortunate oi these intluences was his
acquaintance with Varius and Vergil, who inspired him with
warm admiration and regard; and it was these friends who
- performed ior him the inestimable service of introducing him
to Maecenas.
