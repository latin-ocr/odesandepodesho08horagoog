INTRODUCI'ION.¹ vii

This kind oi literature, which is almost entirely, ii not
entirely, Roman (Satura quidem tota nostra est, Quint. X.
1. 93), had not originally the same meaning that satire has
at present ’ Its real meaning is “miscellam'' (cl. lanx sa·
acra, lex satura), and it was lirst used, so far as we know,
by Ennius (nc. 239-169) to describe a collection os verse
with mixed metros as well as mixed subjecta. This mean·
ing was also followedby Pacuvius, his nephew, and later by
M. Terentius Varro, the great antiquarian, a contemporary os

Cicero. Lucilius, in the time of Africanus the Younger, used '

the word to denote a series oi pictures of lise and manners in
verse (generally hexameter), more nearly, though not entirely,
in the style which we now call satirical. His satires, oi which
we have fragments, consist os scenes and character sketches
from lise, and are generally, though not always, aimed at the

iolly and wickedness oi mankind, particularly as found in the
party opposed to the cllque of Scipio and his friends. 'lhe exact

connection os Lucilins' efforts with Greek models is not clear.
In Horace's time there seems to have been no idea that there
was any immediate connection with anything Greek except a
remote one with the Old Comedy. Some oi the writings ol
Ennius may have suggested the development that Lucilius gave
to satire. Tbere was evidently also among the Romans astrong
tendency towards dramatis composition ol a lighter kind, as is
indicated by the Fescennine and Atellane iarces. There was
also a strong tendency to “ convicia,” or personal abuse in con·
versational lorm, “chaffing,” or “Billingsgate.” There were
also extant at that time some compositions in Greek called
Σίλλα, which seem· to have been poetica! semidramatic char-
acter sketclres, something like the prose writings oi Lucian.
These vSr'lloi may have given a suggestion to Ennius and Lucil·
ius; and as the comedy which would naturally have sprung
from all these seeds was crowded out by the translation oi
the more advanced Greek dramas‚ the Satire seems to have
been the result os the comic tendency ol the Romans turned
