ln the hands ol Sappho and Alcaeus, and ol Catullus,
this verse had a much freer movement. The quantity ol
the fourth syllable was not fixed, arrd there was no regular
caesura. ln Hor'ace the fourth syllable is invariably long
(see 146b) and caesura in the dactylis strictly observed,
usually falling alter the long syllable; ‘feminine' caesura
(wl o) is frequent in the Carmen samtareand iu Book
IV, rare in the earlier books.
