Quinque dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum

Sextilem totum mendax desideror. Atqui

si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem, ι

quam mihi das aegro, dabis aegrotare timenti,

dissignatorem decorat lictoribus atris;

dum pueris omnis pater· et matercula pallet,

officiosaque sedulitas et opellaforensis
adducit febris et testamenta resignat.
