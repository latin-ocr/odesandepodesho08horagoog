Tira Epistles belong, as wellas the Satires, to Horace's
Musa pedestris. They are, like them, conversational moral or
literary essays (Sermoncr,· ct11. r. 250), of which the topics
are suggested by current events or occasional moods and rela-

other compositions was probably that these were first sent to
the person addressed and afterwards copied by his permission.
They were written alter Horace’s farne became established, sn

their composition is not exactly fixed except in a few cases, but
they belong to the latter part of the poet's life (see 1. 3 3 1. ro),
