by another, caused hythe general familiarity with the poet, has
made it next to impossible to establish any families, or any pre·
cedence of any one over others, or even of any doaen over the

rest So that what we have of Horace is a text very much
’ altered by the tinkering of scholars according to their knowl-
edge and whims, but at the same time checked oli by reference
to the constant stream of tradition. This process has appar·
ently been going on from the poet’s own nme. So that very
Ἴ little can be done now in the way of improvement of the text,
unless some manuscript should come to light that has lain un·
used for more than a thousand years. For a description of the
manuscripts, the student is referred to Orelli and (lese fully)
Kellerand-Holder. ·

. The Satires and the poems generally seem to have been first
written for private reading and circulation, somewhat as single
poems appear nowadays in ephemeral literature and are later
collected into volumes, and not to have been properly published
until some time after their composition. Exactly at what time
this was done in the case of the Satires is unknown, but we may
well suppose that the first book was published before ac. 33,
in which year Horace received from Maecenas the gift os his
Sabine farm, a gift which can hardly be looked upon otherwise
than as aretum for the cornpliment of the dedication to Ma
cenas in I. r. There is no clear indication that the two books
of Satires were published separately, yet there is a slight differ·
ence of style between the two, and the scene with Trebatius in
11. 1. seems to indicate a new undertaking, a conclusion which
-is also strengthened by the completeness of the first book and
ι the evident incompleteness of the second' ¹

The form of composition Horace himself mus Sermones, to
distinguish it from the higher ssights of poetry which he attempta
in his lyrics. But the name Satura must also have been given
to the work at the time (asin11.1.1),and has always been
the prevailing title.
