offa 1f this is taken, the meaning
is, ‘⁶ Why do you always match (in
argument) things squarely opposed
to each other, as is there were
nothing between, setting only the
two extremes against each other,

against the mean.” 1t may also be
taken in the sense of put together,
is. identifying things utterly incon·
sistent and unlike, as not being a
miser with being a spendthnfl, and
not being a spendthrrss' with bein a
miser, whereas Horace shows t at
there is a middle ground, and con-
sequently these things supposed by
the miser to be the same are really
utterly opposed to each other. ·
