his success in the Epodes had encouraged him to try hi
hand at more complicated lyrical metres. He made carefr
studies in early Greek lyric, taking as his especial model
and guides the two great poets of Lesbos, Alcaeus an·
Sappho (about 600 ac.) Just when Horace began to writ
what we call the Odes, but which he called simply poem

(camma), it is not possible to say. In fact, the line of di
vision between the Epodes and the Odes isa somewha
arbitrary one, and a few poema are found under each hear
that might equally well have been placed under the other
The earliest of the odes to which adate can be assigne‹
with certainty is 1. 37, written on receiving the news of thr
death of Cleopatra in nc. 30. Possibly some were writter
before this, but probably not many. From this time on, for
about seven years, Horace devoted himself with great zea]
and industry, and almost to the exclusion of every other
kind of literary work, to lyrical composition. His mastery
of form and fine rhythmical sense had here their highest
opportunity, and the result was a body of lyric which in
volume and variety and in perfectiori of finish was never
equaled in Latin literature before or after. Catullus, a gen·
eration earlier, had written lyrics which in freshness and
spontaneity, and as direct and unaffected expressions of the
poet's personality, Horace himself could not equal. But
> Catullus had written chiefly in the easier lyrical merres,—
iambics, Glyconics, and particularly the Phalaecean, his
favorite rhythm. He tried the Sapphic strophe in only two
poems‚-one of these a translation-and the Alcaic not
at all. These two, with three Asclepiad strophes which
Catullus did not touch, were the rhythms that Horace de
veloped most successfully, and, after many experiments with
other forms, came to use almost exclusively. He also
worked in accordance with strict metrical theories, formulated
probably by the Roman philologlans of the time, and not by
