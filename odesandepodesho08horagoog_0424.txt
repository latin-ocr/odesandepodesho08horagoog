known to history occurred about the middle oi the third
century nc. It was instituted under instructions irum the
Sibylline Boolrs, which had been consulted in consequence
oi certain alarming portents; and the oracle gave further
directions that the celebration should be renewed every
hundred years (Varro ap. Censor. ¹⁷· 7). It was at this
time, then, according to Varro, that the Iudi Terentrhi
