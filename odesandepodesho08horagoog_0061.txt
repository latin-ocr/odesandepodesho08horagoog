INTRODUCTION.

‘Tru Infinitive.

9ι. The socalled ‘Historr'col Infinitioe’ occurs nowhere
in the Odes and only once in the Epodes (5. 84 lenire). ln
the Satires it is not infrequent, and three instances of its
use are found in the Epistles. Ἴ

93. The Infinitive r'n Exclamatum is used twice in the ⁰
Fpodes (8. r rogare3 rr. 11 valere), and tour times in the
Satires (I. 9. 7 3 surrexe 3 11. 4. 83 sq. radere, dare; ΙΙ. 8. 67·
torquerier). In all these examples except the hrst it is intro
duoed by-nc. It does not occur in the Odes or Epistles.

93. The Iryinitivc os Purpos'e was an old colloquial
construction, used especially aiter verbs of movement; as
Ter. Hec. 345 intro iit uidere, he has gone in to sce. It is fre-
quentin comedy, but except in the phrase do (or, once,
mrhr‘stro) bibere is not found in classicnl prose writers ; nor
did it, like rnost poetical constructions, obtain ‘a footing in
later prose. The Augustan poets took it up, under Greek
influence, but used it sparingly. The examples in Horace
are as follows:

Alter werbe oi moweurentr C. 1. a. 8 pecus eglt altos risere mon·
ὼς C. 1. sp ro non te frangere persequor; C· 111. 8. rr amphoree
turnum bibe‘re institutae. With hado: C. l. ad 3trlstitiam et
metue nedem protervis ln mere Creticum portare ventis. With
euno, Μάιον choore (as a subjecti: C. l. 12. 2 quern sumis cele-
brare? Ep. 1. 3. 7 quie',sibl res gestes Augusti scribere sumit?
With other verbe; Ep. l. 2. 27 truges consumere nerl; ΕΜ. ro 16
(see note).

94. The Complementary Irpinitivc. For the colorless ex·
pressiori oi will, desire, intention, ellort, power, capacity,
aud the like, by such verbs as volo, nolo, mpr‘o,possum, cogito,
conor, which take a simple infinitive to denote the action (oi
the same> subject) to which they point, it is natural in ani·
mated discourse to substitute words more vividly expressive
of the feelingor power to be indicated. Some of these
tound their way into classicalprose. Thus Cicero, to ex·
