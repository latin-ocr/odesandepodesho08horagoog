[κη 47-

mella cava manant ex ilice, montibus altis
,s levis crepante lympha desilit pede.

ἢ s‘

Illic iniussae veniunt ad mulctra capellae,

5ο refertque tenta grex amicus ubera,
nec vespertinus circum gemit ursus ovile,
⁴ neque intumescit alta viperis humus ;
61 nulla nocent pecori contagia, nullius astri
gregem aestuosa torret impotentia.
53 Pluraque felices mirabimur, ut neque largis
aquosus Eurus arva radat imbribus,

exsilit ad caelum rann‘s fila-ibus
arbos Ι utebaturque novas frondes
et non sua poma—pullat i.e.

all the uss. after vs. 60. where it is
obviously out of lace and inter-
rupts the course o thought, which
