has an even number oi verses, the unit ot versification being
a strophe ol two verses—the epodic distich irom which
the book derives its name (i 18). ln the Odes the number
oi verses is in all cases a multiple oi tour, with the excep
tion oi C. 1v. 8, which contains 34 verses. ln view oi this
striking fact, and in spite oi C. lv. 8, —the text ot which
is open to grave suspicion on grounds quite independent oi
its metrical structure,- Meineke laid down the canon that
Horace's odes were composed in tetrastichs, or strophes oi
lour verses, and that accordingly where an ode is< apparently
written in distichs or monostichs, these were designed to be
grouped together to lorm tetrastichs. This theory rests on
a much narrower basis oi induction than appears at first
sight ς lor oi Horace's ‘¹04 odes only 18 are written in dis·
tichs, and in monostichs only 7. Horace may have desired
to make these iew odes conform to the rule imposed on the
great majority by their metrical structure, but that is a dii-
lerent thing lrom saying that the unit oi versification was
the tetrastich. ln a number oi the odes the distichs are oi
the same character,—in two odes identical (see 162),—
with those used in the Epodes, where they cannot he
grouped in twos. It is true that the text ol C. lv. 8is
probably corrupt, hut it is by no means clear that a reduc·
tion to ³² orto 28 verses is the way to heal it. lt is true,
further, that in C. 111. 9, which is a dialogus, two distichs
at a time are assigned to each speaker,-one would be
rather short ior the purpose, but in C. 1. 1, on the other
hand, a division into tetrastichs is curiously at cross pur·
poses with the course oi thought, while the significant
manner in which the first two and the last two verses
are set oll by their content lrom the rest ol the poem
points to a probable grouping oi such monostichs in twos, ’
ii they have any strophic character at all. In the remaining
monostichic odes (l. 11, 18, 111. 30, lV. 10)-leaving out
