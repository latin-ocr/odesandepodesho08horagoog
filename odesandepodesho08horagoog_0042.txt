’ xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

poem of this collection, an epistle to a‘young friend and man
of letters, Julius Florus, is also mainly devoted to literary
matters, and is especially interesting for its many allusions
to Horace's own literary career. Its general purport is that
he has now come to a time of life· when he must put aside
poetry with other amusements of youth, and address him·
self to the ‘rhythms and harmonies of real lite! For this
reason its composition is assigned with great probability to
the period immediately following the publication of the first
¹ book of the Epistles, when Horace's lyrical muse was still
silent,÷say uc. 19 or 18. The epistle to Augustus, on the
other hand, was probably written at least as late as nc. 14

34. These two epistles are followed in modern editions
by the longest of Horace’s poems (476 hexameters) and
the one that approaches nearest to the character of a
= formal treatise. lt is largely didactic, setting forth with
much detail of precept and illustration, the correct principles
of poetry as an art ς and as early as the first century it was
known under the title of Ars Poett‘ca (or De Arte Poetr‘ca
liber). It is, newertheless, written in the fonn, and to a
considerable extent preserves the character and tone, of an
epistle, being addressed to three friends, afather and two
sons, of the Piso family, and ostensibly designed for the
special benefit of the elder of the two young men, who had
literary aspirations. It is, moreover, for aformal treatise,
very incomplete; it deals with only one branch of poet'ry‚.—
the drama, -with any degree ofthoroughness, touching on
the rest lightly or not at all. It seems probable, therefore,
that the somewhat pretentious title Ars Pactam did not
originate with Horace himself, but was given to the poem
’ later, when it was issued separately, either for education'al
purposes or as material for learned commentary. The
date of its composition is in dispute. Some place it as
early as the first book of the Epistles, but the better view
