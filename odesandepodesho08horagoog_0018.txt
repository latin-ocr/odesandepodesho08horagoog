It is important to observe the significance of these dates.
Horace's life began when the Romans were still living
under the forms oi the Republic; when it closed, the
. Empire was fully established. When our poet first saw the
light, Cicero was planning his canvass for the consulship.
His boyhood‘fell in the stormy decade of the ‘First Trium·
virate' (nc. 60-50), which formed the prelude of the Civil
War. Horace was old enough to be interested in the later

victories of Caesar in Gaul, and the destruction of Crassus

belong to the first half of the principare of Augustus, the
period oi the growth and consolidation of his power under
the guidance of his two great ministers, Agrippa and
Maecenas, whose deaths, tac. ra and 8, were closely followed

Lucanian border. lt stood on a branch of the Aufidus,
in that region aswift mountain stream, among the wooded
hills which culminate in the lofty peak of Mt Voltur.
There the poet's father by shrewdness and thrift had not

, but had acquired a modest farm and an income which

enabled hina to educate his son. His occupation was that
of a coactor, that is, a collector oi money—whether of
money due for taxes or for goods sold at auction, the cor·
rupt text of the Suetonian biography leaves us in doubt.
