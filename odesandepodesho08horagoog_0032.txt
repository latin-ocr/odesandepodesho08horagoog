the elder Pliny's word for it that in the last three years o
his life he did not sleep at all. Maecenas married Terentia
a sister (by adoption) of Licinius Murena, who was execute‹
for conspiracy against the emperor in⁴ nc. ²3· She was 3
beautiful woman, who 'counted tbe gossips said, Augustus
himself among her lovers; and her husband oscillatec'
between furious jealousy and complete subjection to her
fascination. He incurred the emperor's displeasure, when
her brother’s conspiracy was detected, by letting her draw
the secret from him. These jars produced no permanent
estrangement between Augustus and his minister, but there
were other circumstances which inevitably caused Maecenas’
influence to wane. When the rule of Augustus had become
firrnly established and began to take on the character of an}
hereditary monarchy‚ the members of his own family
naturally came into greater prominence in his councils.
Among these was Agrippa, who had married his daughter
Julia. Maecenas was outside the circle and his relation with
his chief could not be the same as before. ,
22. Maecenas was a man of cultivated mind and taste,

· with agenuine appreciation of literature 3ηά enjoyment of

the conversation of rnen of letters. He even wrote indiffer-
ent verses himself. But he showed his love of literature in
a much better way by bestowing upon it a liberal, and what
was more to the purpose, a discriminating patronage. He
did this in part as a measure of policy; he saw that literature
might serve a useful purpose in reconciling the nation to the
new order of things. lt was rare good fortune for Octavian
to have a minister who not only saw the wisdom of this
'policy‚ but had the taste and the tact to carry· it out with
success; it was something rnore than good fortune for
Maecenas that he won the gratitudo and admiration of the
two greatest poets of the age, and that his name from that
day to this hasbeen a synonym for patron of letters.
