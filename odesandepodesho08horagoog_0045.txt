lessness, while the ‘Blandinius Vetustissimos’ is justly held
to be ol exceptional importance both on account of the
excellence ot someoi its peculiar readings and because it
represents a tradition in large measure independent oi the
great massot Horatian manuscripts. Cruquius also pub
lished in his edition a collection oi scholia from his Blan-
dinian manuscripts, the unknown writer or writers ol which
are commonly quoted as ‘Commentator Cruquianus! They
are ol no great value, being evidently derived, for the most
part, from hero and Porphyrio.

library at Beme, written by a Scotch or lrish mouk in the
latter part ot the eighth or early in the ninth century'. We
have nearly twenty in all which appear to have been written
before the end ot the tenth century. All ot the manuscripts
(except one at Gotha, which appears to be derived from the
Blandinian recension) come from a common archetype, which
Keller thinks may have been written as early as the first or
second century. No satisfactory classitication has yet been
discovered, which shall enable us to decide on disputed
readings by the weight oi manuscript testimony; nor is it
probable that the relations ol the manuscripts to one another -
ean ever be sufficiently made out to establish such a classi·

fication. Owing to the practice in which copyists and Ι

revisers often indulged, ol comparing their codex with one
or more others, and borrowing readings from these at their
'discretion the lines ol tradition have become so confused
that it is probably no longer possible to separate them.
This appears in Keller's attempted classification, in which
an important manuscript.will be lound now in one class,
now in another. Keller sets up three classes, and in general¹
accepts the united testimony ot two against the remaining
