The caesrua is occasionally hepthemimeral (as ΕΜ ι. ι 53
4. 33 5. 3, etc.); in two verses it falls· alter the prefix ol
a oompound word: Epod. ι. ¹9 imlplamidas; rr. ¹5
in Ι aestuet (cl. 149, 150, r 5 5, and see ιι 5 e). Resolution
is sparingly used. The apparent dactyl occurs chiefly in
the first tuot, seldorn in the third; the tribrach oftenest
in the seoond and third, rarely in the first or fourth; and
both ot these substitutione are always so rnade that the
tetus coincides with a word-accent (in two cases with a
secondary accent only: Epod. ¹7· 12 hbmt'ct'dam: 74 interit
cis), usually falling on the antepenult ol a trisyllabic word.
The anapaest occurs in the first loot only twice: Epod. 2.
35 portellum, 65 positos (which are perhaps to be read by
syncope as spondees; see 183); and apparently three
times in the fitth ι Epod. 2. 35 laqueo, 5. 79 udaius, 11. 23
mulr'erculom,· but see 180, 181.
136. The Pure Iambt'c Trimeter:

A hepthemimernl caesura occurs once (Epod. 16. 4).
137. The IambicDimeter:

’ ⁶ The metrical scheme is here given, to avoid tantustantus the lorm
presented in the Greek and Latin grammate in common use lambio
rhythm may also be represented, ln accordance with our modern system
oi musical notation, thus: ὅ ξ .. υ .. ὅ Ι.. υ etc3 and it will be
necessary to adopt this method ior those rhythms which are used in
composite and logaoedlc verse, where, though technically iamblc. they
are essentially trochalc ln character.
