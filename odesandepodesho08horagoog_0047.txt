ssavor, he rarely uses a construction oi which we cannot find ⁴
at least the germ in the Latin idiom. lt we bear in mind
that Latin was a spoken language, in process ot growth and
decay, not hardened into the forms in which the gram·
marinus bave systematized it lor us, we may well hesitate
to assert that Latin idiom was ever consciously violated .
by Horace. His‘language is, in the main, the everyday
language ot cultivated Romans, but lree lrom the sprinkling
ot Greek words and phrases with which polite conversation
covered up its own poverty, and which he expressly con·
demus in Lucilius. Horace uses Greek words spmingly,
and as a rule only ot Greek things. His diction betrays no
striving to avoid the commonplace. His power and charm
lie rather in the skill with which he moulds common
materials into exquisite forms, and in that perfect adapta·
tion ot word to thought which invests his carelully wrought
phrase with all the appearance and the freshness ot a happy
inspiration. This ‘Horati curiosa felicitas,’ as Petronius ⁴
has so aptly characterized it, is his supreme merit3 and itis ’
all his own. .

The exposition which follows is designed to help the* stu·
dent to a better understanding' of the poet by pointing out
the most salient characteristics of his symae-chiefly those ·
in which he goes beyondthe limlts oi literary prose usage,
-and to set forth some of the more striking features of
his use and arrangement of words. This will serve, it is
hoped, to show the student what, to look tor, but the largest
part must still be done by himself. There are innumerable
subtleties ot form and setting which 'are beyond the reaeh
of description. To grasp the tull beauty and charin ol
Horaoe’s style, we must read and read over again, read many

times and learn by heart‚ till the poet’s thought and his verse
are inseparably blended in our tnemory.
