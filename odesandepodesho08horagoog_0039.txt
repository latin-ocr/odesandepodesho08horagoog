was troubled with an affection of the eyes. But as he grew
older his health began to fail, and he found it necessary to
guard it carefully. lu spite of the friendly reproaches of
Maecenas, he spent a good part of the year away from the
city, among the hills at his villa orat Tibur or Praeneste, or
on the seashore at Baiae or Tarentum.

30. Horace never married, nor was he ever taken posses
sion of by an overmastering passion, like his friend Tibullus
and the other elegiae poets. Among all the feminine names
that occur in his lighter odes only one appears to be real, -
that of Cinara, of whom he speaks only after her early death.

’ Tm Lydias and Lalages, and all the rest of the Greek ladies
who figure in his love poenis are creatures of his fancy, or
of the fancy of some Greek poet before him; and if, as is
no doubt to some extent true, the poems reflect the poet’s
own experiences, they also show how lightly these experi-
ences touched him. Horace was not of a temperament to
make a serious business of love; and his artistic delinea-
tions of it are pretty, but they have not the ring of genuine·
ness and true passion. Something of the same sort must
be said of his convivial odes. They must be taken as
artistic productioris, not as seli-portraiture. Horace enjoyed
good wine and was very sociable by disposition, and he no
doubt often found himself, especially in his younger days, in
boisterous company; but by his whole nature and training
excess of all kinds was distasteful to him, and it is impos· ·
sible not to believe that his strong selfcontrol rarely. failed ,
to assertitself here. The odes in which he enjoins modera-
tion in the use of wine reflect not only his rule but, we may
confidently believe, his habitual practice.
