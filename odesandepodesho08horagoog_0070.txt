their general characteristica are plainly marked. In prose
the greatest freedom of movement is accorded to the verb,
which may be placed, with little reference to the position of
its subject or object, wherever emphasis or the order of
¹ thought or rhetorical form may suggest. On the other hand
’ amodifier of any ltind must keep reasonahlynear its noun
· or verb, and the least· liberty ol all is allowed to an attribute
and its substantive. These as a rule are not separated
except hy unemphatic words, —pronouns, particles, and the
like—as ‘magna ex parte,' ‘angustos se fines (habere),'
‘quanto id cum periculo (fieret).' Yet Roman prose writers
permit themselves occasionallya compact group'like ‘eodem
usi consilio,' ¹(de) ea quam habeat gratia’ ς or even a longer
group, especially where the inserted ¹words themselves con·
stitute a modilier, as ‘tua in me vel nota omnibus vel ipsa
novitate meorum temporum clarissima et maxima beneficia)
‘meam tuorum erga me meritorum¹ memoriam! But such
combinations have a rhetorical flavor in prose, and are in
fact sparingly used. ln verse, on the other hand, they are
rather the rule than the exception; the poets have studi-
ously wrought out artistic groupings and sequences which
the reader must train himself to grasp and follow, if he
would appreciate the beauty of poetical expression. The
fonus are too varied and complex to be set forth fully,
but the following examples, chiefly from Horace's lyric
poems, may serve to indicate their character and point
out the way to study them.
