xlx. This ode portmys, in a
lively dramatic form which reminds
of 1. ²7· ι symposium. There are
two distinet scenes, one occupying
the first eight verses, and the other
the remainder of the poem. How
these are to be combined, Horace
has by no means made clear.
Perhaps the most probable ex·
planation is this = On a sunny
