181. smannens: c, 111. 4. 41 cousinio· 111. ⁶. ⁶ pnn-
optim (in both cases the consonantal i lengthens the preced-
ing syllable, and its own syllable is elided at the caesura);
Epod. 22. 7 2122222· perhaps also Epod. 5. 79 inferius, and
11. 23 ηιαὶιῗναιΙανη (see 135),

182. Dranvsrs: C. Ι. 23. 4, Epod. 23. 2 siluae.

pos(r)tum (see 235). Syncopated verb forms like natarunt,
complesti, intrarit, promorat are ol frequent occurrence.

284. Ecisrou. ln his earliest-Epodes Horace appears to ,

have studiously avoided elision. ln Epode 16 the hexame
ters are altogether free from it, and it occurs but three
times in the iambico. There is no case in Epode 23, and
only one in Epode 12. Later he was less strict, but
contined it chiefly to short final syllables, and avoided harsb
combinations. Monosyllables are never elided‚ except the
pronouns mc and te, and (once) the adverb iam (Epod. 17· ι).

185. Hlarus occurs alter the interjectione a and o, which,
lor obvious reasons, are never elided‚ and in the lollowing .
