INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

lu the summer oi nc. 17 Augustus instituted a remark·
able festival,-one that, in the words ol the herald who
proclaimed the coming event, no living man had ever seen
or would ever see again. The Quindecimviri, who had
charge oi the Sibylline Books, had produced an oracle
which called‘ior the celebratiou ol the ludi saeculares. Ι

The origin ol this long iorgotten festival was obscure.
lt appears to have grown out oi the ludi Terentiei, a religious
observance associated with the oldest traditions oi the
Valerian family, and witha place iu the Campus Martius
called Terentum (or Tarentum), where there were hot
springs and other evidences ol volcanic influence. lt was
'on the banks ol the river, at the great bend below the
Ponte San Angelo. T he healing properties ol these springs
were said to have been lirst revealed to Valesius the
Sabine, who commemorated his gratitude lor the miraculous
healing ol his three children by the institution ol sacrificeS,
with other ceremonies and entertalnments‚ on three suc-
cessive nights, at the ancient subterranean altar oi Dis and
Proserpina, which under the guidance oi an oracle he had
discovered on this spot. (See Val. Max. 11. 4. 7.)

Tradition ascribed the lirst celebration ol the ludi Teren-
tim‘ as a public institution to the consul Valerius Poplicola,
in the first year ol the Commonwe'alth, and mentioned sub
sequent celebratione by other Valerii The srrst celebration
